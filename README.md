# Carcassonne Android App
Small app to keep scores in a [Carcassonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)) match.

At the moment the idea is to have a central server that keeps track of points made. Clients should be able to start matches as well as get information from games already started.
